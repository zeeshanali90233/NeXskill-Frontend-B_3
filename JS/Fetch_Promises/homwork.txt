That Take the city name through input and 
then call the API to get the current weather detail of that place

Map the data that come from api , like temperature, wind speed to dom in a div

API Detail: 
URL: https://p2pclouds.up.railway.app/v1/learn/weather?city=karachi


!!!Hint: Use Template Literal to make the link dynamic with city name

If no data comes from api than show message that city not exist
and show message "Error Occured" if city not found
